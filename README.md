There are two buttons:

- **AOV Standard Setup**: uses the enabled passes from the Render Layer node;
- **AOV Compact Setup**: Uses the enabled passes from the Render Layer node along with the default light passes;

> [!IMPORTANT]
> _For now this addon was designed to work with Cycles and Eevee engines only._

- Blender_AOVs_BacktoBeauty_Compact_Cycles_v1;
- Blender_AOVs_BacktoBeauty_Standard_Eevee_v1;
