This repository provides a complete **AOV - Back to Beauty** workflow from Blender to Compositing in Nuke or Fusion:
- **DL_FileOutput** for Blender to set the AOV names automatically;
- AOVs Back to Beauty Templates for Nuke/Fusion;

# DL_FileOutput
This free addon creates a File Output node inside Blender and sets the AOV names (render passes), automatically.

It was developed and tested in **Blender 4.1.0**.

![testing_buttons_v003_](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4f3d9781-2a4e-4a1d-9c4a-bff0bf65115e)


There are two buttons:

- **AOV Standard Setup**: uses the enabled passes from the Render Layer node;
- **AOV Compact Setup**: Uses the enabled passes from the Render Layer node along with the default light passes;

In summary, the Compact setup provides a straightforward AOV combination directly inside Blender, so you will get the final result for some render passes.

For example:
- **Diffuse Light** = Diffuse Direct + Diffuse Indirect;
- **Diffuse Albedo** = which is the original Diffuse Color;
- **Reflection** = Glossy Color x (Glossy Direct + Glossy Indirect);
- **Refraction** = Transmission Color x (Transmission Direct + Transmission Indirect);
- **Volume** = Volume Direct + Volume Indirect;

> [!IMPORTANT]
> _For now, this add-on has been designed to work only with Cycles and Eevee engines._
